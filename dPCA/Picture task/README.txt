"demixed pca" scripts were used to run the analysis on the Presentation period of this task, exploiting the toolbox available at https://github.com/machenslab/dPCA.
We modified some of the toolbox files ("dpca_ecc.") to adapt them for our analyses. Explained variance modified function is found on "visuomotor task" folder.
